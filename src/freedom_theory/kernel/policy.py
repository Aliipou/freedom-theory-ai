"""
Policy IR — ABAC-style rule layer on top of the capability kernel.

The kernel (OwnershipRegistry + RightsClaim) is a capability system:
authority flows through explicit delegation. The Policy IR is a
complementary attribute-based layer that lets you express rules of
the form "deny all writes to /data/secret/* by machines" without
wiring individual claims.

Rule evaluation order: highest priority first; first match wins.
Default effect applies when no rule matches.

Usage:
    from freedom_theory.kernel.policy import Policy, PolicyRule, PolicyVerifier

    policy = Policy(
        name="data-access",
        rules=[
            PolicyRule(effect="deny",   operations=["write"],
                       resource_scope="/data/restricted", priority=100),
            PolicyRule(effect="permit", operations=["read"],
                       actor_pattern="analyst-", priority=50),
        ],
        default_effect="deny",
    )

    pv = PolicyVerifier(kernel=verifier, policy=policy)
    result = pv.verify(action)
