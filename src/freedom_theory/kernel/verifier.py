"""
FreedomVerifier — minimal deterministic AGI permission gate.

Checks exactly four things:
  1. Hard sovereignty/corrigibility flags (instant FORBIDDEN)
  2. A4: every machine has a registered human owner
  3. A6: no machine governs any human
  4. Resource access via rights claims (read/write/delegate)

No manipulation detection. No synthesis engine. No conflict queue.
Those are extension concerns. This gate is formally verifiable and has
no LLM dependencies or external I/O.

Wire-in:
    verifier = FreedomVerifier(registry)
    result = verifier.verify(action)
    if not result.permitted:
        agent.halt(result.summary())
